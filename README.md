# Stadius Move V2

This is the enhanced version of Stadius Move on Thionville, the traffic info scraping bot for Citéline buses.

This bot uses Selenium (for ease of use) to scrape real-time bus traffic information from the Citéline network in Thionville. The aim is to inform users of disruptions, as using the carrier's website is not very ergonomic.

This project is a significant improvement over V1, which dates back to November 2022.

This program includes scraping, text processing of information, layout (in an image in Instagram storie format) and publication.

## Important information ⚠️:

The current code contains significant imperfections, with considerable room for improvement (notably through the use of requests). This second version was coded in one evening.
In addition, the instagrapi librairy is not official and may cause problems with instagram.
